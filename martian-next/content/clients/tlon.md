Tlon engaged us to architect and implement the core distributed systems infrastructure for their next-generation decentralized communication platform. This involved designing novel network protocols that could operate efficiently in peer-to-peer environments while maintaining the user experience of centralized systems.

We developed a custom gossip protocol for message propagation that achieves eventual consistency across globally distributed nodes with minimal bandwidth overhead. The system uses advanced NAT traversal techniques and WebRTC for direct peer connections, falling back to relay nodes when necessary. Our implementation includes sophisticated congestion control and quality-of-service mechanisms.

The architecture supports millions of concurrent users across thousands of nodes, with automatic scaling and self-healing capabilities. We implemented comprehensive testing infrastructure including network simulation environments that model real-world conditions like packet loss and variable latency. The platform now serves as the foundation for Tlon's entire communication ecosystem.
