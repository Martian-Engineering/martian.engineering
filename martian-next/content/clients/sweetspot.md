Sweetspot needed a robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation that could scale to enterprise requirements while maintaining security and compliance standards. We developed a custom MCP host from the ground up, designed specifically for their unique business requirements.

The solution featured advanced connection pooling and load balancing to handle thousands of concurrent AI model interactions. We implemented sophisticated caching strategies and request deduplication to optimize API costs while maintaining low latency. The system integrates seamlessly with existing enterprise authentication systems via SAML and OAuth 2.0.

Our security-first approach included end-to-end encryption, audit logging, and role-based access control. We also built comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems that provide real-time insights into system performance and usage patterns. The platform now handles over 10 million requests daily with 99.95% availability.
