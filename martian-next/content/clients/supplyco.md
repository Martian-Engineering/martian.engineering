SupplyCo engaged us to augment their engineering team with senior developers that could support support them in growing their prototype into a production-ready application.

We initially worked with them on making their Airflow DAGs more robust, and later helped them migrate their data pipeline to Dagster. We've developed extensive E2E tests of both systems to ensure reliability and stability.

Since then we've also helped them build robust REST APIs, improved their development workflows, supported them with bugs across their stack, and improved LLM-produced data quality.
