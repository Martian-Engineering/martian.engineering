      duration: '8 months',
      technologies: ['Python', 'Apache Kafka', 'Kubernetes', 'PostgreSQL', 'Redis', 'OpenAI API', 'LangChain', 'Pinecone', 'Docker', 'AWS'],
      fullDescription: `We architected and implemented a comprehensive data processing infrastructure for NEAR Foundation's blockchain ecosystem. The project involved building high-throughput data ingestion pipelines capable of processing millions of blockchain transactions daily, with real-time transformation and enrichment capabilities.

Our team developed a sophisticated embeddings generation system using state-of-the-art language models to create semantic representations of blockchain data, enabling advanced search and analysis capabilities. We implemented custom vector search infrastructure supporting millions of documents with sub-second query times.

Key achievements included reducing data processing latency by 85%, implementing fault-tolerant mechanisms for 99.9% uptime, and creating a scalable architecture that automatically handles traffic spikes during high blockchain activity periods. The system now serves as the backbone for NEAR's data analytics and machine learning initiatives.`

      technologies: ['TypeScript', 'Node.js', 'React', 'WebSockets', 'Redis', 'PostgreSQL', 'Docker', 'Model Context Protocol', 'OAuth 2.0', 'JWT'],
      fullDescription: `Sweetspot needed a robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation that could scale to enterprise requirements while maintaining security and compliance standards. We developed a custom MCP host from the ground up, designed specifically for their unique business requirements.

The solution featured advanced connection pooling and load balancing to handle thousands of concurrent AI model interactions. We implemented sophisticated caching strategies and request deduplication to optimize API costs while maintaining low latency. The system integrates seamlessly with existing enterprise authentication systems via SAML and OAuth 2.0.

Our security-first approach included end-to-end encryption, audit logging, and role-based access control. We also built comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems that provide real-time insights into system performance and usage patterns. The platform now handles over 10 million requests daily with 99.95% availability.`

      technologies: ['Rust', 'Go', 'WebRTC', 'libp2p', 'QUIC', 'Protocol Buffers', 'PostgreSQL', 'Redis', 'Kubernetes', 'Prometheus'],
      fullDescription: `Tlon engaged us to architect and implement the core distributed systems infrastructure for their next-generation decentralized communication platform. This involved designing novel network protocols that could operate efficiently in peer-to-peer environments while maintaining the user experience of centralized systems.

We developed a custom gossip protocol for message propagation that achieves eventual consistency across globally distributed nodes with minimal bandwidth overhead. The system uses advanced NAT traversal techniques and WebRTC for direct peer connections, falling back to relay nodes when necessary. Our implementation includes sophisticated congestion control and quality-of-service mechanisms.

The architecture supports millions of concurrent users across thousands of nodes, with automatic scaling and self-healing capabilities. We implemented comprehensive testing infrastructure including network simulation environments that model real-world conditions like packet loss and variable latency. The platform now serves as the foundation for Tlon's entire communication ecosystem.`

      technologies: ['Python', 'TypeScript', 'LangChain', 'OpenAI API', 'Anthropic API', 'Vector Databases', 'GitHub Actions', 'Docker', 'Terraform', 'AWS'],
      fullDescription: `Extend brought us in to revolutionize their engineering team's development workflows through strategic AI integration. We conducted comprehensive assessments of their existing processes and identified key areas where AI could significantly improve productivity without compromising code quality or security.

We implemented custom AI-powered code review systems that provide intelligent feedback on pull requests, catching potential bugs and suggesting optimizations based on the team's coding standards. Our solution includes context-aware code generation tools that understand the project's architecture and automatically maintain consistency with existing patterns.

Beyond tooling, we developed comprehensive training programs that helped engineers at all levels effectively leverage AI assistants while maintaining critical thinking and code ownership. We established best practices for prompt engineering, security guidelines for handling sensitive data, and metrics for measuring AI tool effectiveness. The team saw a 40% improvement in development velocity while maintaining high code quality standards.`

      technologies: ['Java', 'Spring Boot', 'Apache Spark', 'Kafka', 'Elasticsearch', 'MongoDB', 'React', 'D3.js', 'Kubernetes', 'Terraform'],
      fullDescription: `SupplyCo needed a complete overhaul of their supply chain management infrastructure to handle exponential growth and increasingly complex logistics networks. We designed and implemented a microservices-based architecture that could process millions of transactions while providing real-time visibility into global supply chain operations.

Our solution features advanced optimization algorithms that continuously analyze supply and demand patterns, automatically adjusting inventory levels and routing decisions to minimize costs while meeting service level agreements. We implemented machine learning models for demand forecasting that reduced inventory holding costs by 30% while improving order fulfillment rates.

The system includes comprehensive real-time dashboards built with D3.js that provide executives with instant insights into supply chain performance. We also developed sophisticated alerting mechanisms that proactively identify potential disruptions before they impact operations. The platform now manages over $2 billion in annual inventory movements across 50+ countries with industry-leading efficiency metrics.`

            Luke is a 3rd-generation programmer specializing in cryptography, networking protocols, and performance optimization. Since dropping out of college to co-found Sia, a leading cloud storage cryptocurrency, he has worked across all layers of the stack, from ASIC mining firmware to JavaScript frontends; TCP multiplexing to distributed consensus; vectorized assembly to novel Merkle tree research, and more. He treats programming as an end in itself, and outside of work he enjoys tinkering with a new language designed for competitive programming.

            <br />
            <br />
            Liam's experience includes networking protocols, decentralized applications and developer tooling. His most recent project was an experimental application layer for Urbit that unified build systems, smart contracts and user facing applications, which involved subprojects spanning systems, frontend and application programming. His previous projects include Tlon's secure decentralized messenger, which is the largest application on the Urbit platform, as well as working on the Urbit kernel in various capacities. He studied Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Queensland before dropping out.
