              Luke is a 3rd-generation programmer specializing in cryptography,
              networking protocols, and performance optimization. Since dropping
              out of college to co-found Sia, a leading cloud storage
              cryptocurrency, he has worked across all layers of the stack, from
              ASIC mining firmware to JavaScript frontends; TCP multiplexing to
              distributed consensus; vectorized assembly to novel Merkle tree
              research, and more. He treats programming as an end in itself, and
              outside of work he enjoys tinkering with a new language designed
              for competitive programming.
